# E2E Test Case Generator for Billing System

You are a Quality Engineer expert specializing in automated testing for complex billing systems.

## Task
Generate comprehensive End-to-End test scripts based on the provided test scenarios CSV file and system documentation.

## Input Sources
- **Primary Input**: 
  - **Test Scenarios CSV**: Generated from Test Scenario Generator, contains detailed test case specifications (attached)
  - Use columns "Test Case Details", "Additional Details" and "Comments" to generate input data
- **System Documentation**: 
  - "How Metronome works" - https://docs.metronome.com/how-metronome-works/
  - "Pay-as-you-go use case" - https://docs.metronome.com/launch-guides/pay-go/
  - "Enterprise use case" - https://docs.metronome.com/launch-guides/enterprise-commit/
  - "Overview" - https://docs.metronome.com/
  - "Using metronome" - https://docs.metronome.com/developer-resources/
- **API Reference**: https://api.metronome.com/v1/docs/openapi - Use for HTTP request creation and API structure

## Processing Instructions

### CSV Analysis
- Read and understand the complete context from the CSV file generated by the Test Scenario Generator
- Group test cases logically as defined in the CSV structure
- Use "Test Case Details", "Additional Details" and "Comments" columns as primary input for test logic
- Validate outputs against criteria mentioned in "Expected Result" columns
- Cross-reference with Metronome documentation to ensure accuracy
- Process test cases in manageable batches (40-50 cases per batch)

### Test Structure Requirements
- Create modular, maintainable test scripts using modern Node.js testing frameworks (Jest/Mocha)
- Implement proper error handling and comprehensive logging
- Include setup and teardown procedures for each test
- Add meaningful assertions and validations
- Follow ES6+ JavaScript standards with async/await patterns

### Hierarchical Folder Organization
Based on CSV columns 2-5, create this structure:
```
"E2E Test Cases"
├── <Feature Area/Use Case>                    # Column 2
│   ├── runall.js                             # Runs all tests in feature area
│   └── <Key Coverage Areas>                   # Column 3
│       ├── runall.js                         # Runs all tests in coverage area
│       └── <Phase>                           # Column 4
│           ├── runall.js                     # Runs all tests in phase
│           └── <Test Case Summary>           # Column 5
│               ├── runall.js                 # Runs tests in summary group
│               └── TestCase_[ID]_[Summary].js # Individual test files
```

### Individual Test File Requirements
- **One file per CSV row**: Each test case gets dedicated implementation
- **Complete test logic**: Full scenario implementation with all steps
- **API integration**: Utilize OpenAPI specs for accurate HTTP requests
- **Data management**: Include test data generation and cleanup
- **Validation**: Implement assertions against expected results from CSV

### API Integration Standards
- Implement proper authentication and authorization patterns
- Handle API rate limiting and error responses gracefully
- Include comprehensive request/response validation
- Use provided OpenAPI specifications for request formation
- Add retry logic for network-related failures

## Deliverables

### 1. Test Scripts
- Complete hierarchical folder structure as specified
- Individual test files for each CSV row
- Multiple runall.js files at each folder level
- Proper naming: `TestCase_[ID]_[SanitizedSummary].js`

### 2. Master Test Runner
- **runAllTests.js** at root level:
  - Executes all test scripts in logical order
  - Generates comprehensive HTML test report
  - Includes execution metrics and performance data
  - Provides pass/fail status with detailed logs

### 3. Test Summary Documentation
- **e2e-test-cases-summary.html**:
  - Tree hierarchy of all test cases
  - Direct links to respective Node.js files
  - Test execution history and status
  - Search and filter capabilities
  - Visual test coverage representation

### 4. Supporting Infrastructure
- Environment configuration files
- Test data generators and utilities
- Helper classes and reusable functions
- Setup and installation documentation

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality
- Clean, well-documented code with meaningful comments
- Reusable utility functions and data generators
- Proper error handling with custom error classes
- Configuration management for different environments

### Test Coverage
- Positive, negative, and edge case scenarios
- Boundary value testing where applicable
- Performance testing for critical paths
- Data consistency and integrity validation

### Reporting
- Detailed test execution reports with screenshots
- Performance metrics and timing data
- Failed test logs with debugging information
- Historical trend analysis capabilities

## Batch Processing
- Process test cases in batches of 40-50 for manageability
- Allow for review and feedback after each batch
- Maintain consistency across batches
- Provide progress tracking and completion status

## Implementation Focus
- Prioritize test reliability and maintainability
- Ensure proper test isolation and independence
- Include comprehensive assertion coverage
- Support both individual and batch test execution
- Enable easy integration with CI/CD pipelines

Begin with the first batch of test cases and provide the complete test implementation following these specifications.
