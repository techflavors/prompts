Step 1: 
Create a static HTML website that replicates the interface shown in the
attached screenshot. Build it as a single HTML file with embedded CSS
and JavaScript, optimized for GitHub Pages hosting.

Step 2: 
Add the following updates to the website:
Header section with title "Demo Merchant App" on the left and "Logged in as TestCustomer" on the right
Layout restructure with left sidebar navigation menu and main content area on the right

Sidebar menu items: "Manage Plan" (display billing interface replica) and "Manage Usage" (show iframe content with sample data)

Step 3:
Replace the static iframe with dynamic JavaScript injection. Create a script
called "thirdparty-sdk.js" that programmatically creates and injects the
iframe into the page when needed.

Step 4:
Add a new sidebar menu item called "Show Transactions" that uses AJAX to
fetch content from transaction.html and displays it within an iframe. Create
transaction.html as a separate file with a table containing dummy transaction
data: Transaction ID, Payment Method, Dollar Value.

Step 5:
AJAX Error: Unable to fetch transaction.html
Make sure the file exists and is accessible

Step 6: 
Create a Show Transactions2 menu with a different approach to dynamically create an iframe element, inject it into
the DOM, and write HTML content directly into the iframe's document using
iframe.contentDocument.write(). Create a different Java script file if needed so the code for Manage Usage is sepaerately maintained from the code for Show Transactions2

Step 7:
Create a Node.js Express server to serve the HTML application through HTTP
endpoints

Step 8:
Test all functionality and create GitHub Actions for automated deployment

Step 9: 
Analyze the transaction.html structure and create a PostgreSQL database
schema that matches the data format. Generate a SQL table with appropriate
columns and insert realistic sample data that corresponds to the
transaction display format.
