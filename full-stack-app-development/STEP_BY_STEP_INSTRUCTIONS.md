   - Created realistic sample customers
   - Generated diverse merchant data
   - Added various payment methods
   - Inserted comprehensive transaction records matching both frontend formats
   - Ensured data consistency across all tables

3. **Query Examples (`queries.sql`)**
   - Created queries matching frontend requirements:
     - Transaction listing for both implementations
     - Analytics and statistics queries
     - Search and filtering operations
     - Revenue and performance metrics
   - Added administrative and reporting queries
   - Included data validation and cleanup operations

4. **Database Management (`database/manager.js`)**
   - Built Node.js PostgreSQL integration
   - Implemented connection pooling
   - Created data access layer functions
   - Added error handling and query logging
   - Built functions matching API endpoints

5. **Automation and Setup (`database/setup.sh`)**
   - Created automated database setup script
   - Added data validation and verification
   - Implemented error checking and rollback
   - Included environment configuration
   - Added database connection testing

6. **Documentation**
   - Created `database/README.md` with setup instructions
   - Built `database/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` with technical details
   - Documented all database operations and relationships
   - Provided troubleshooting and maintenance guidance

1. **Full Stack Integration**
   - Connected frontend to Node.js API endpoints
   - Integrated database with backend services
   - Tested complete data flow from database to frontend
   - Validated all AJAX operations and dynamic content loading

2. **Code Validation and Testing**
   - Verified all file structures and dependencies
   - Tested server startup and API functionality
